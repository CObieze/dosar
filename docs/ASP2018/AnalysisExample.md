# ATLAS Analysis Example

## Introduction

Root may be run in batch mode on the grid to analyze large data samples. This example creates simulated data in root format using trees and performs analysis on the simulated data by means of processing on the grid. This example is based on a demo developed by OU programmer Chris Walker.
